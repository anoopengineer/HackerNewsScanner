# Hacker News Scanner App

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/anoopengineer/HackerNewsScanner.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/anoopengineer/HackerNewsScanner)

##What
Hacker News Scanner is a tablet ready Android app to access [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) site. 

##Why
1. Because the [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) site is an eye sore to read, both on a desktop and on a mobile device
1. Because we wanted a no ad experience - which none of the current "free" apps were providing
1. Because we wanted to goof around with the new Android L APIs and the material design
1. Because if was fun!
